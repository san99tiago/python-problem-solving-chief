# LEETCODE PROBLEM 001 (SOLUTION 2)

"""
DESCRIPTION:
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they 
add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may 
not use the same element twice.

Example:
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
